# CANOpenNode_stm32F4
CANOpenNode stack drivers for STM32F4xx with HAL library.
This is an adaptation of the code made by <a href = "https://github.com/w1ne/CANOpenNode-CubeMX-HAL" >w1ne</a>. The code has been tested on STM32F407VGT6 and works perfectly for SDO and NMT messages. I've used it to communicate with Motor Controller nanotec C5-E-09.
